ANALYZING BAY WHEELS BIKE SHARING (2018 QUARTER IV))

by Ayoade Olayiwola

Dataset & Data Overview
In this investigation of the Bay Wheels Bike Sharing System (formerly Ford GoBike System), I set out to examine the characteristics of riders as it relates to trips taking and their use of the bike sharing service.

The dataset used contains monthly individual trip data from October 2018 to December 2018 in CSV format covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Though data exists for every month, I chose to work with data for the last quarter of 2018. When combined this dataset contains 446,956 rows and 16 columns, each row representing an individual's trip records on 16 variables The dataset contains information about the trips, the station and the members. The dataset hosted on the site (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data) has excluded some variable which are important to my investigation. I was however able to locate a dataset with the missing variable. The project leaves room to source your own dataset.

I performed an exploratory data analysis on the dataset using Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, patterns and relationships. This was followed with exploratory analysis from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships
